                    <p>As dentists, we are very dependent on the quality of our support team. They have a large bearing on how well we can perform our jobs, as well as how easily you can get an appointment with the dentist of your choice, for your requirements.</p>
                    <p>I am extremely fortunate, to have a long serving, loyal and capable team behind me, in both practices, with Amco, Amy, Arnett, Jade, Maree (my partner), Rachel and Shaniece, being the people making your appointment, as well as assisting us.</p>
                    <p>The day to day running of the practices is almost exclusively performed by these, very capable team members, including the ability to answer most enquiries.</p>

                    <h3>BSc, Dip Pharm, BDS - Dentist</h3>
                    <p>After growing up in Auckland, a career in pharmacy brought me to Napier Hospital. I subsequently studied dentistry at the University of Otago, and graduated in 1993 to work in private, and hospital, dentistry here in Hawkes Bay. Kennedy Rd Dental was opened in 1995, and Omahu Rd Dental a few years later. The focus of my work since has been to provide accessible braces (orthodontics) to patients.</p>
                    <p>I have fantastic support in my partner Maree, and two wonderful grown up children, Tim and Sophie, as well as two adorable greyhounds Michael and Suzie. My interests are running, swimming, cycling and anything with a motor! I also studied law at the University of Waikato, and was admitted to the bar in July 2023. </p>

                    <p>Growing up in Gisborne, I graduated from the University of Otago in 2013. I spent my first 2 years as
                        a dentist at Hastings Hospital which gave me fantastic clinical experience. I still enjoy helping them
                    out when I can.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with the team at Kennedy Rd Dental ever since, apart from an eight-month
                    break to have our lovely son Oliver with my fiancé Nick.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy spending time with my family and our animals, Arya the cat and Charlie our Border Collie.</p>

                    <p>Having ties to the Hawkes Bay through both of my parents encouraged my decision to move here from Dunedin after finishing dental school in 2021.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about helping others with a gentle, patient and informative style of dentistry.  I enjoy working with the team at Kennedy Rd and hope to have a long rewarding career here.</p>

                        <p>The price variation between practices is usually visible in the level of equipment sophistication. Similarly, different practices have dentists with varying ranges of expertise, and carry out a wider ranges of treatments, which greatly affects cost of treatment.</p>
