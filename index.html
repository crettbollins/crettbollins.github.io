                    <p>As dentists, we are very dependent on the quality of our support team. They have a large bearing on how well we can perform our jobs, as well as how easily you can get an appointment with the dentist of your choice, for your requirements.</p>
                    <p>I am extremely fortunate, to have a long serving, loyal and capable team behind me, in both practices, with Amco, Amy, Arnett, Jade, Maree (my partner), Rachel and Shaniece, being the people making your appointment, as well as assisting us.</p>
                    <p>The day to day running of the practices is almost exclusively performed by these, very capable team members, including the ability to answer most enquiries.</p>

                    <h3>BSc, Dip Pharm, BDS - Dentist</h3>
                    <p>After growing up in Auckland, a career in pharmacy brought me to Napier Hospital. I subsequently studied dentistry at the University of Otago, and graduated in 1993 to work in private, and hospital, dentistry here in Hawkes Bay. Kennedy Rd Dental was opened in 1995, and Omahu Rd Dental a few years later. The focus of my work since has been to provide accessible braces (orthodontics) to patients.</p>
                    <p>I have fantastic support in my partner Maree, and two wonderful grown up children, Tim and Sophie, as well as two adorable greyhounds Michael and Suzie. My interests are running, swimming, cycling and anything with a motor! As well as attending dental courses I am studying law.</p>

                    <p>I grew up in Caves Beach, NSW, Australia, and studied dentistry at Charles Sturt University, situated in rural NSW. My introduction to Napier was in 2018 for a six-week holiday working on the vineyards.</p>
                    <p>This resulted in me falling in love with the local community, and subsequently joining the team at Friendly Dental Clinics in 2019.</p>
                    <p>I thoroughly enjoy dentistry, but outside of this, also enjoy touch football, travelling, reading, hiking and cooking.</p>

                    <p>Growing up in Gisborne, I graduated from the University of Otago in 2013. I spent my first 2 years as
                        a dentist at Hastings Hospital which gave me fantastic clinical experience. I still enjoy helping them
                    out when I can.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with the team at Kennedy Rd Dental ever since, apart from an eight-month
                    break to have our lovely son Oliver with my fianc√© Nick.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy spending time with my family and our animals, Arya the cat and Charlie our Border Collie.</p>

                    <h3>BDS - Dentist (Scotland)</h3>
                    <p>I was born and brought up in Scotland. I lived in South Africa for 5 years where I trained as a nurse & midwife before returning to Dundee in 1988. I gained my dental degree from Dundee in 1996 and have worked in the Community, Hospital, and general Dental Dental Services. My last post in the UK was teaching anxiety management as part of the special needs team.</p>
                    <p>I moved to New Zealand in 2009 and joined the Friendly Dental whanau. I have been in our Omahu Road practice since 2011 where our team have enjoyed providing good, basic dental care to our local community</p>

                        <p>The price variation between practices is usually visible in the level of equipment sophistication. Similarly, different practices have dentists with varying ranges of expertise, and carry out a wider ranges of treatments, which greatly affects cost of treatment.</p>
